2. Auto Level

    - I saw a lot of switching back and forth between 2 levels in AL2, possibly due to titimps. Considering you lose the remaining titimps bonus when switching maps when calculation AL2 titimps bonus should be ignored or be considered always on
    - Have it check the difference between 2 results and if it's within a few % use the current map
